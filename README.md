# AlluGames

AlluGames is a project developed during my studies at Alura to explore Kotlin OOP concepts and HTTP functionalities. The main goal of this project is to create a game review website, similar to Letterboxd but focused on games.

## Features
- Integration with a game API to fetch and display game information.
- Object-Oriented Programming principles implemented using Kotlin.
- HTTP requests to retrieve data dynamically.

## Purpose
This project serves as a practical way to:
- Apply Kotlin programming skills in a real-world context.
- Understand and utilize HTTP functionalities for data interaction.
- Build a foundation for creating websites with a specific purpose, like reviewing and rating games.

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication and profiles.
- Implement a rating and review system.
- Enhance the UI/UX for better navigation and usability.

## Setup
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your system.
3. Run the project using your preferred Kotlin IDE or command-line tools.
